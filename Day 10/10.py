"""
    When "noop" is encountered, nothing happens except the cycle iterates.
    When "addx" is encountered the first time, EXECUTE is set to true and the
    instruction gets duplicated and inserted as the next instruction.
    That way, the cycle iterates twice per "addx" instruction, but only gets
    executed when the second, duplicated instruction is encountered. At that
    point, the value is added to X and the EXECUTE flag is reset to False.
